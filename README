This is a plugin for tumbler (the thumbnailing system used by Thunar and other file managers), that allows
it to produce thumbnails for directories/folders based on custom images.

The plugin checks if a directory contains a ".thumbnails" hidden subdirectory which may contain one or many 
image files (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.) which depict what the directory's thumbnail should be at different 
rendering sizes in the file manager. For example, an image at .thumbnails/32.svg would be used as the 
source image when rendering the thumbnail at size 32.

The plugin uses the following logic for selecting images:
- Images should be named numerically (e.g., 16.png, 32.svg, 64.png, 128.jpg)
- The smallest numbered image in the directory is used for any rendering at that size or smaller
- The largest numbered image is used for any rendering at that size or larger
- Any intermediate image sizes are used for rendering at that size or larger up until the next specified image
- Images not named numerically are ignored

The goal of the plugin is to enable using different folder thumbnail styles at different rendering sizes, 
such as using more detailed thumbnails at larger icon sizes or more symbolic/simpler thumbnails at smaller 
icon sizes.

The plugin will remove any cached thumbnails for a directory if it is found to no longer have a .thumbnails 
subdirectory.

The .so plugin must be copied manually to your tumbler plugins directory (e.g., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/tumbler-1/plugins 
or /usr/lib/tumbler-1/plugins) after being built. You can use the included install.sh script for this.
